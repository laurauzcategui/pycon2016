 - Quick help on: [How to deploy in PythonAnywhere](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uDLeDaXdBZQIrsjZ1BMmQsdoGTnt181th6TMfzJbRJA/edit?usp=sharing)
 - If you don't want to run many times pip install for each module/library execute this on your project directory:
    - ```pip freeze > requirements.txt```

  Then in each environment you will be able to run only:

  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
  
 - To-Do:
    - Remove one post
    - Include images per post
    - Add profile page
    - Embed video
    - Deploy in other sites: i.e heroku
